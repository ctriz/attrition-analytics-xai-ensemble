                            The visualization highlights that features like <code>{topFeature}</code>, <code>JobMarketIndex</code>, and <code>TownhallAttendance</code> dominate attrition predictions, with XGBoost placing higher emphasis on external factors (e.g., <code>JobMarketIndex</code>) compared to CatBoost’s focus on internal signals (e.g., <code>HierarchyLevel</code>). This underscores the critical role of data quality and feature engineering in HR analytics, enabling targeted interventions to reduce turnover costs by $2–5M in 2025’s competitive labor market.
